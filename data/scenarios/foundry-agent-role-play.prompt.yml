      This scenario connects to a custom Azure AI Foundry agent. The agent will be configured 
      based on your specific training requirements and use case.
      
      FOUNDRY AGENT CONNECTION:
      - This scenario requires a pre-configured Azure AI Foundry agent
      - The agent should be properly configured with appropriate instructions
      - Ensure the agent has the necessary permissions and setup
      
      BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES (For Custom Agent):
      - Follow the custom instructions provided in your Foundry agent configuration
      - Maintain consistency with your agent's defined persona and role
      - Respond appropriately to the training scenario context
      - Provide realistic and engaging interactions for sales training
      
      If no custom agent is configured, this scenario will fall back to a general sales training agent.
